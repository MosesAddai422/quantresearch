This optimal hedge project involves the use of Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and K-means for optimal hedge identification. PCA is used to reduce the number of features in the data whiles maintaining majority of the variability whiles k-means is used to group the stocks or derivatives by volatility. The clusters are then used to determine optimal hedge weights for the various assets in a given portfolio. 

The second project employs the Monte Carlo simulation to price options with the Black-Scholes model as the underlying framework. The model algorithm assesses the option prices at different simulated random paths and backtracks from maturity to the present in order to determine optimal exercise strategy at each step based on comparison between immediate payoff and continuation value.
